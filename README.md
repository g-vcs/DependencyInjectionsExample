# ðŸ§© DependencyInjection-Hilt Android Example  

This is a simple Android project that demonstrates how to implement **Dependency Injection** using **Dagger Hilt**, a library built on top of Dagger to simplify DI in Android applications.

The example follows modern Android development practices with **Kotlin** and uses Hilt as the primary dependency injection framework to promote clean architecture, reduce boilerplate, and improve testability.

This project is a practical companion to my Medium article:

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project  
This project shows how to use **Dagger Hilt** to inject dependencies in Android components like Activities and ViewModels, minimizing boilerplate and improving testability.

It covers the essential DI setup:

- `@Inject` â€“ injects dependencies via constructor or field  
- `@Module` and `@Provides` â€“ defines how to create instances  
- `@HiltAndroidApp` â€“ initializes Hilt in the Application class  
- `@AndroidEntryPoint` â€“ allows Android classes to receive injections  
- Field injection
- Named injections for different implementations of the same interface

The example includes a simple use case with a `Veterinarian` class that depends on an `Animal` interface. Youâ€™ll see how to inject a `Cat` or `Dog` implementation using Hilt.
